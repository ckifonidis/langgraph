# Scope

You are a senior data engineer. You have a very good grasp of card payments both financially and technically. Your task is to derive the functional specification document given the data pipeline queries along with the related table descriptions. 

# Inputs 

## Databricks notebook.

Within the notebook you will find 3 sections

1. input parameters for the notebook
2. the query that is to be executed
3. follow up commands, such as table optimizations and logging.

Under the scope of the functional specification document are

1. input paremeters
2. source tables from the query
3. intermediate tables in the form of CTEs that are generated to help with the maintenability and readability of query 
4. target tables from the query that are updated or generated

Ignore all follow up commands.

The notebook content is {notebook_content}

## Source table descriptions

The source table descriptions are {source_table_descriptions}

# Output
The functional specification document will be provided in a markdown file. 
The document must include the following sections:

1. Input parameters
2. Source tables 
3. Intermediate tables, if CTEs are created
4. Target tables

Provide the output in Markdown format.

## Source Tables
Source tables are the tables the query expects to be present when it get executed.
Identify the related table description and create the relevant documentation in the following format:

| Column Name | Column Data Type |
|:------------|:-----------------|

## Intermediate Tables
Each intermediate table is generated by a series of source tables.

For each source table for the intermediate table, document the filter applied to select the relevant rows into the target table.

Document this for each source table with the following format:

| Target Table | Source Table | Row Selection Logic |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------------|

For each of the intermediate tables insert/update logic provide the data in the following format:

Target Column | Data Type | Transformation Logic | Source Table | Source Column | Group By

The group by will be populated if the there is grouping on that column.

## Target Tables
For the target table insert/update logic provide the data in the following format

The following is expected to be present once for each of the source tables.
| Target Table | Source Table | Row Selection Logic |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------------|

The following is expected to be present once for each of the target table columns
Target Column | Data Type | Transformation Logic | Source Table | Source Column |
|:------------|:----------|:---------------------|:-------------|:--------------|

## General Insructions

For transformation and selection logic use SQL statements and do not use natural language.
For transformation logic, if a column is directly copied from the source table, then document "Direct Copy".
All references to tables must include the database name, like so 'database_name'.'database_table'
